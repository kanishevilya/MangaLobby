Since birth, Naruto has been shunned and ridiculed by his fellow villagers. But their contempt isn\'t because Naruto is loud-mouthed, mischievous, or because of his ineptitude in the ninja arts, but because there is a demon inside him. Prior to Naruto\'s birth, the powerful and deadly Nine-Tailed Fox attacked the village. In order to stop the rampage, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside the body of the newborn Naruto.\\n\\r\\nAnd so when he is assigned to Team 7—along with his new teammates Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, under the mentorship of veteran ninja Kakashi Hatake—Naruto is forced to work together with other people for the first time in his life. Through undergoing vigorous training and taking on challenging missions, Naruto must learn what it means to work in a team and carve his own route toward becoming a full-fledged ninja recognized by his village.\\n\\r\\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","title_ov":"Naruto"}',

One day, Ichigo returns home to find an intruder in his room who introduces herself as Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper tasked with helping souls pass over. Suddenly, the two are jolted from their conversation when a Hollow—an evil spirit known for consuming souls—attacks. As Ichigo makes a brash attempt to stop the Hollow, Rukia steps in and shields him from a counterattack. Injured and unable to keep fighting, Rukia suggests a risky plan—transfer half of her Soul Reaper powers to Ichigo. He accepts and, to Rukia\'s surprise, ends up absorbing her powers entirely, allowing him to easily dispatch the Hollow.\\n\\r\\nNow a Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo must take up Rukia\'s duties of exterminating Hollows and protecting spirits, both living and dead. Along with his friends Orihime Inoue and Yasutora Sado—who later discover spiritual abilities of their own—Ichigo soon learns that the consequences of becoming a Soul Reaper and dealing with the world of spirits are far greater than he ever imagined.\\n\\r\\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","title_ov":"Bleach"}',

On the way to school one day, Alice rescues a white rabbit from the road despite the danger to herself, but gets rescued by Kyo and receives a bracelet with a single red stone. The rabbit she saves, however, is no ordinary rabbit. She reveals her true form to Alice and introduces herself as Nyozeka. Alice is told that she is destined to become a Lotis Master. The Lotis Masters use the power of words and communication to enter the Inner Heart of others. It is a powerful ability to be used carefully as Alice soon finds out.\\n\\r\\nUsing the power of the Lotis Words, which reveal themselves to be in the form of runes, Alice accidentally makes her older sister disappear during a dispute over Kyo, whom Mayura had begun dating. Alice then must use the Lotis Words to try and bring her sister back from the dark. She is joined by Kyo who proves to have the Lotis powers as well, and by Frey, another Lotis master who had trained with the masters and arrives with the intention to marry Alice. Unfortunately, Mayura has been taken by the power of the Maram Words, the dark reflection of the Lotis Words. Their only hope lies in Alice and Kyo becoming the legendary Neo-Masters to discover the lost word bonding both Maram and Lotis.\\n\\r\\n(Source: Mangatraders)","title_ov":"Alice 19th"}',

Kyouko has never appeared at any of the kingdom\'s past ceremonies, and doesn\'t plan to attend this ceremony either, for doing so will end her youthful school life.\\n\\r\\nHowever, her father, the king of Earth, offers her another option—Kyouko must find the 12 telepaths who can use the God Stones in order to wake up her twin sister, Princess Ui, who has been asleep since her birth. If Kyouko succeeds, the king will allow her to live however she likes, and will pass on her duties to her sister. Accepting this offer, Kyouko is given the first of the God Stones, the Time-Space Stone, and will need to find the remaining God Stones and their users, with the help of her two bodyguards Sakataki and Hizuki Jin.\\n\\r\\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","title_ov":"Time Stranger Kyoko"}',

The trouble is, Kiri inherited chiseled masculine features from her father and Tohya inherited his mother\'s delicate beauty. For years, Kiri has been working hard toward becoming a girl worthy of Tohya, but even now, she faces constant reminders that everyone regards her as unsuitable for him due to her lack of femininity.\\n\\r\\nOne day, Tohya is scouted by a fashion photographer and agrees to work as a model for the agency owned by Kiri\'s mother. Kiri is concerned that Tohya will be preyed upon by other men in the fashion world, and so she begs her mother to hire her as well. Her wish is granted with a twist, as she is forced to pose as a male model under the name \\"Tatsuki.\\" During their first photo shoot, it seems that Kiri\'s worries are well-founded when the photographer won\'t keep his hands off Tohya. With the desire to protect Tohya warring against the fear that she will appear undesirable to him the longer she pretends to be male, Kiri must come to terms with her identity and decide if outer beauty is really more important than what lies inside.\\n\\r\\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","title_ov":"Never Give Up!"}',
